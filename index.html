                Writer. 
                Sometimes a cup of green tea and peacefull environment
                with a immense of thoughts makes my day.
                So I often write. 
                Here you will get some poems and some random text.
                And for this reson I call myself a Free Writer.
                No one is born a writer. You must become a writer. In fact, you never cease to become, because you never stop learning how to write. Even now, I am becoming a writer. And so are you.
                What could you do that would make you feel more like a writer today (e.g. finishing a story, writing a blog post, taking a long walk with your notebook, reading a good book, etc.)?

   Life is a journey
   Where you will meet many people
   Some will love you, 
   some will leave you.
   Some will fake you, 
   some will make you.
   Some want you to be the best 
   And some want you to be like rest all.
   Some will actually be by your side,
   no matter what and some will just pretend.
   Some will be happy with you
   and some not.
   Some will never need an explanation
   from you and for some that is also not enough.

    All the way I walked 
    but this storm held me too close.
    I don't know what makes me too strong 
    when it hits too hard, 
    and I find myself on the ground.
    Bouncing back with a sweet smile
    is all I want in my life.
    Now I just let these storms come my way because
    one day they will be the reason
    for stronger me, the better me.
    Allowing these stormy winds, 
    to blow away all the negative emotions.

    Starting with a hope,
    and just thinking when will I succeed ?
    This should not be everyone 's goal.
    How come a single day
    would define your beautiful journey?
    It is the journey which you can
    make or ruin, not the destination.
    Your personality is the sum of your struggles,
    failures and experiences you gained
    throughout your journey.
    Destination just exists for the day all the way
    it's a journey that reoccur now and always.

    Where all those small moments
    now turned into memories,
    Where all those fights were scary but 
    now remembering them you ended up with a sweet smile.
    Where our fights used to last 
    not more than a few minutes
    but now we ended up having misunderstandings. 
    Where our emotions were pure,
    nothing was wrapped in sweet talks.
    Where we laugh out loud daily,
    we hardly miss the chance to enjoy ourselves.
    Where we had lived in the present as now
    we either live in past or the future.
    Where all our dreams used 
    to change every single day
    and now we are running each 
    day for a single dream.
    We all have grown up from those to this day.

    Those days were good when the hope was alive,
    to achieve you, she was on her ride.
    Then, the journey was a nightmare 
    but now feels like it was a heavenly time.
    To fall each day and get up with
    the hope of doing better.
    For the world, she "just failed",
    but for her, she lost everything.
    To admit that her dream will never
    be on her way is hard.
    It might be an unfulfilled dream,
    but will always be alive in her.
